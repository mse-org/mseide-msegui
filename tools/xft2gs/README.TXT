Script "do_xft.sh" :

  1) obtains list of all fonts available via Freetype library
  2) analyzes Freetype fonts configuration ( /etc/fonts/fonts.conf )
  3) based on 1) and 2) builds file "./Fontmap.GS.xft" which can then 
     be added to "Fontmap.GS" file ( GhostScript fonts mapper ) 
     on your system ( or can even replace all its contents if 
     no one except MSEgui works with PostScript ).

The purpose is to achieve expected look of fonts in GhostScript 
for PostScript data generated by the MSEgui's postscript printer 
component ( exactly as these fonts look on display in 
MSEgui applications ).

To have least problems with GhostScript finding TTF 
( and other not GS-supplied ) fonts, me recommend to create links 
to all nedeed fonts files in /usr/share/ghostscript/fonts/
directory. 
The easiest way to do that is:
- enter /usr/share/ghostscript/fonts/ directory
- for each directory with TTF fonts ( $TTF_DIR ), call command :
   = lndir $TTF_DIR

  It'll create the necessary links.

 * Obviously, you can store real font files in this directory 
   but ususally XfssTT & Xft expect these files to be in /usr/share/fonts/,
   and you can get incorrect Xft setup.

========================

MSEgui constructs GhostScript font names from FreeType ones 
used in appications as follows :

{font name}[-[Bold][Italic]], examples :

  Times,
  Times-Bold,
  Arial Narrow-BoldItalic
  
"Bold" & "Italic" aren't replaced with locale specific keywords neither 
in MSEgui nor in generated PostScript data. But some fonts may describe 
oneself to be "Bold" or "Italic" in other languages. To cope this issue, 
this script detects the styles nor via the notation but 
the numeric info - "slant"(angle) and "weight".

If you will still have inexact look of "Times", "Courier" and "Helvetica" 
fonts then remove ( or comment out ) the following section of 
"/etc/fonts/fonts.conf" :

        <match target="pattern">
	  <test name="family"><string>Times</string></test>
	  <edit name="family" mode="append" binding="same">
	    <string>Nimbus Roman No9 L</string>
	  </edit>
	</match>
        <match target="pattern">
	  <test name="family"><string>Helvetica</string></test>
	  <edit name="family" mode="append" binding="same">
	    <string>Nimbus Sans L</string>
	  </edit>
	</match>
        <match target="pattern">
	  <test name="family"><string>Courier</string></test>
	  <edit name="family" mode="append" binding="same">
	    <string>Nimbus Mono L</string>
	  </edit>
	</match>

and restart XWindows for the change to take effect.


Good luck !
